        <p>Borscht is a sour soup popular in several Eastern European cuisines, including Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Ashkenazi Jewish and Armenian cuisines. The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which gives the dish its distinctive red color. It shares the name, however, with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht and cabbage borscht.

        <p>Salo is a traditional, predominantly Slavic food consisting of cured slabs of fatback (rarely pork belly), with or without skin. The food is commonly eaten and known under different names in countries across the region. It is usually dry salt or brine cured. The East Slavic variety is sometimes treated with paprika or other seasonings, while the South Slavic version is often smoked.</p>

        <p>Pierogi, also known as varenyky, are filled dumplings of Central European origin made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savory or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water. These dumplings are popular in West Slavic (Polish and Slovak), Hungarian, East Slavic (Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian), Baltic (Latvian and Lithuanian) and other Central and Eastern European cuisines where they are known under their local names. However, pierogi are especially almost always associated with Poland and Slovakia, where they are considered national dishes.</p>

        <p>Kompot is a non-alcoholic sweet beverage of Slavic origin, that may be served hot or cold, depending on tradition and season. It is obtained by cooking fruit such as strawberries, apricots, peaches, apples, rhubarb, gooseberries, or sour cherries in a large volume of water, often together with sugar or raisins as additional sweeteners. Sometimes different spices such as vanilla or cinnamon are added for additional flavor, especially in winter when kompot is usually served hot.</p>
